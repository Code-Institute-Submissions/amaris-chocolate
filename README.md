# Amaris Chocolate website

## Milestone Project 1
This is a website for Amaris Chocolate, an existing small producer of handcrafted bean to to bar dark chocolates from Croatia.
The chocolates are made with the high percentage of cocoa parts (70% or more). Bean to Bar production is a specific method of 
crafting practiced by chocolate makers that are involved at every stage of the process that the cacao bean goes through.

The main goal of the website is to build and promote the brand awareness, expand the existing market and to increase the sales.

Amaris Chocolate website was created as a Milestone Project 1 as a part of **Diploma in Full Stack Software Development** with **Code Institute**.
