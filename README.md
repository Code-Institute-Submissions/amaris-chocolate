# Overview
This is a website for **Amaris Chocolate**, an existing small producer of handcrafted bean to to bar dark chocolates from Croatia.
Their chocolates are made with the high percentage of cocoa parts (70% or more). Bean to Bar chocolate production is a specific method of 
chocolate crafting practiced by chocolate makers that are involved at every stage of the process that the cacao bean goes through.

The main goal of the website is to build and promote **Amaris Chocolate** brand awareness, expand the existing market and to increase the sales.

Amaris Chocolate website was created as a Milestone Project 1 as a part of **Diploma in Full Stack Software Development** with **Code Institute**.
The project is developed primarily using HTML and CSS programs, with a small amount of JavaScript implemented for additional functionality.

## Structure

    - Interaction Design
    - Information Design

## Skeleton

## Design
### Colour Scheme
- I used three main colours for this project with the main focus on shades of dark brown colour to represent the feel of luxurious organic dark chocolate.
According to the [Color Psychology](https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-2795824) shades of brown (chocolate) evoke the sense of strength, warmth and comfort.
Also, since the dark brown colour is represented in [Amaris Chocolate's](https://fruitbatm.github.io/amaris-chocolate/) logo, the shades of dark brown were emphasized throughout the website. 

- A Caput Mortuum colour (#5C3324) was used for navigation and footer sections. Fot the text, I used Dark Sienna colour (#38160D) and for the headings, Black Bean colour (#411D13).
For the background I used Linen (#F5E8E1) colour which I alternated with the white colour to create defined sections when scrolling through the website. Furthermore, the light background works well with the dark brown text due to its contrast.

- For the buttons I used Coffee (#774936) colour and for the button hover effect I used Liver Chesnut (#916750) in order to indicate the user that the element is clickable and for the better appearance. 
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a colour palette.

### Fonts
- I used two fonts throughout the project, **Merriweather Sans** and **Merriweather**. Both were used with ``sans-serif`` font as a fallback. 
**Merriweather Sans** was used for the navigation and main headings and **Merriweather** was used for the paragraph sections and footer.

- These fonts are used because of the excellent readability and appearance on screens of all sizes. These fonts were designed to be especially pleasant to read at very small sizes and both harmonize well with one another.

- Both fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Imagery
- For the website I used impactful images with chocolate and cocoa beans motives to promote Amaris Chocolate brand & products, to attract the user's attention and to try to influence the need to make a purchase.
All images are sized and compressed for the best user experience.

- I paid attention that the images match the captions and are labeled with keywords important to the website content in order to improve onsite SEO.

- The images were sourced from the below stock photography websites:

    - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)*
    - [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)*
    - Images provided by the company owner*

### Icons
- I used several icons to improve the website's UX from:
    - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
